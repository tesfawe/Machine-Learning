# Energy Consumption Prediction for Ro-Ro Vessels 

## Overview  
Optimizing **energy consumption** in maritime transport is crucial for **reducing environmental impact** and **improving economic efficiency**. This project leverages **machine learning models** to predict the **energy consumption** of Ro-Ro passenger ships using **sensor data**.  

The work focuses on the **MS Smyril**, a Danish vessel, operating between **February and April 2010**, using a dataset of **1,627,324 records** containing:  
- **Fuel flow rate**  
- **Port pitch**  
- **Wind speed**  
- **Vessel speed**  
- **Navigational parameters**  

## Objectives  
- Develop **machine learning models** to predict **energy consumption (tons per hour)**.  
- Analyze how different **sensor variables** affect fuel usage.
